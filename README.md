# Job Hunter

• I developed a backend system for recruitment management using Spring Boot, inspired by platforms such as TopCV.  
• Candidates can upload files and images, manage their resumes, while employers can post job listings and manage company profiles.  
• I used JWT for authentication and configured an OAuth2 resource server to validate access tokens and token refresh.  
• I built full CRUD functionality for key entities including Company, Job, Resume, Role, Skill, and User, with data stored in a MySQL database.  

**Technologies used:**  
- Spring Boot  
- Spring Security with OAuth2 Resource Server  
- JWT (JSON Web Token)  
- MySQL
